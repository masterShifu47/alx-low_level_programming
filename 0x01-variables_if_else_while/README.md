## Description

In this directory, you will find C programs that demonstrate the concepts of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. Each program focuses on different aspects of these topics and serves as a learning exercise to reinforce your understanding of C programming.

## Files

- [1-positive_or_negative.c](./1-positive_or_negative.c): This program generates a random number and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using a while loop.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using a while loop.
- [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using a while loop.
- [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using the putchar function.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.
- [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c): This program prints all the hexadecimal digits using a while loop.
- [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c): This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using nested loops and the putchar function.

## Requirements

To compile and run these programs, you need to have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system. These programs are written in standard C99 syntax.

## Usage

Follow these steps to compile and run the programs:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired program.
3. Use the following command to compile the program:
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <program_name.c> -o <output_name>
   ```
   Replace `<program_name.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile, and `<output_name>` with the desired name for the executable file.
4. After successful compilation, run the program using the following command:
   ```
   ./<output_name>
   ```
   Replace `<output_name>` with the name you provided in the previous step.
5. The program will execute, and you will see the output on your terminal.

# 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of more functions and nested loops. Each program focuses on a specific task and is designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in these concepts.

## Files

Here is a brief description of each file in this directory:

- **0-isupper.c**: A function that checks if a character is an uppercase letter.
- **1-isdigit.c**: A function that checks if a character is a digit.
- **2-mul.c**: A function that multiplies two integers.
- **3-print_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- **4-print_most_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
- **5-more_numbers.c**: A function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
- **6-print_line.c**: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- **7-print_diagonal.c**: A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
- **8-print_square.c**: A function that prints a square in the terminal.
- **9-fizz_buzz.c**: A program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz", multiples of five with "Buzz", and multiples of both three and five with "FizzBuzz".
- **10-print_triangle.c**: A function that prints a triangle in the terminal.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or navigate to the relevant directory where the files are located.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) with the appropriate flags. For example:
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o program_name file_name.c
   ```
3. Execute the compiled program:
   ```
   ./program_name
   ```

Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your machine before attempting to compile the programs.

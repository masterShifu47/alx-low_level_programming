# Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate various functions and nested loop constructs. Each program focuses on a specific concept or task related to functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Files

Here is a list of the files in this directory:

1. **0-holberton.c**: Prints "Holberton" followed by a newline using a custom `_putchar` function.
2. **1-alphabet.c**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase using a custom `_putchar` function.
3. **2-print_alphabet_x10.c**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times using nested loops and a custom `_putchar` function.
4. **3-islower.c**: Checks if a given character is lowercase using the `islower` function from the standard library.
5. **4-isalpha.c**: Checks if a given character is an alphabetic character using the `isalpha` function from the standard library.
6. **5-sign.c**: Prints the sign of a number: positive, negative, or zero.
7. **6-abs.c**: Computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. **7-print_last_digit.c**: Prints the last digit of a number.
9. **8-24_hours.c**: Prints every minute of the day in 24-hour format using nested loops.
10. **9-times_table.c**: Prints the 9 times table.
11. **10-add.c**: Adds two integers and returns the result.
12. **11-print_to_98.c**: Prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.

## Compilation

To compile any of the C programs in this directory, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_filename>
```

Replace `<filename.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_filename>` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

For example, to compile `0-holberton.c`, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-holberton.c -o holberton
```

This will generate an executable file named `holberton`.

## Usage

To run any of the compiled programs, you can use the following command:

```
./<executable_name>
```

Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of the compiled executable file.

For example, to run the `holberton` program, you can use the following command:

```
./holberton
```

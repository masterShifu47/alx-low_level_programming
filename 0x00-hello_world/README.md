# 0x00-hello_world

This repository contains solutions to the introductory tasks of the 0x00-hello_world project. The project focuses on familiarizing with the C programming language and basic compilation processes.

## List of Files

1. 0-preprocessor: This C program runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the output into another file.
2. 1-compiler: This C program compiles a C file but does not link it.
3. 2-assembler: This C program generates the assembly code of a C code file and saves it in an output file.
4. 3-name: This C program compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
5. 4-puts: This C program prints a specified string using the `puts` function.
6. 5-printf: This C program prints a specified string using the `printf` function.
7. 6-size: This C program prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the specific task directory, e.g., `cd 0x00-hello_world/4-puts/`.
3. Compile the C program using the `gcc` compiler with the following command: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output>`.
4. Run the compiled program using the command: `./<output>`.

Make sure you have `gcc` installed on your system to compile the programs.

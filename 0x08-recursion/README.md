# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. In this project, you will find a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion to achieve various tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of recursion and its implementation in C.
- Learn when to use recursion to solve problems effectively.
- Differentiate situations where recursion is suitable and where it is not recommended.
- Practice writing recursive functions to perform different tasks.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each of which involves implementing a specific function using recursion. The tasks include:

1. Printing a string using recursion.
2. Printing a string in reverse using recursion.
3. Calculating the length of a string using recursion.
4. Calculating the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.
5. Finding the natural square root of a number using recursion.
6. Determining if a number is prime using recursion.
7. Checking if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
8. Comparing two strings with wildcard '*' using recursion.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x08-recursion" directory:

   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x08-recursion
   ```

3. Compile the C files for each task using the provided `gcc` commands.

4. Run the compiled executables to test each task's functionality.

## Files and Directories

- Each task has a dedicated C file that contains the function's implementation.
- The `main.h` file contains the prototypes of the functions used in the tasks.
- Examples of usage for each task can be found in the `main.c` files.
- The `README.md` file contains information about the project and its tasks.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc compiler with the flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

## Style

The code in this project follows the Betty coding style. The code should be checked using the provided `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` scripts.

# 0x08. Recursion

## Description
This directory contains solutions to tasks related to recursion in the C programming language. Each task focuses on a specific concept or application of recursion.

## Files
* [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c): C program that prints a string using recursion.
* [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c): C program that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
* [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c): C program that returns the length of a string using recursion.
* [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c): C program that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
* [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c): C program that returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number using recursion.
* [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c): C program that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.
* [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c): C program that checks if a number is prime using recursion.
* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing function prototypes.

## Compilation
The C files can be compiled using `gcc` with the following flags:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file-name>.c -o <output-file>
```

## Usage
After compiling, the resulting executable can be run as follows:
```
$ ./<output-file>
```

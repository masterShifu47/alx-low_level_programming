# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. Each program focuses on different aspects and functionalities of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

## List of Programs

1. **0-reset_to_98.c**: This program demonstrates how to update the value of an integer using a pointer.
2. **1-swap.c**: This program swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
3. **2-strlen.c**: It calculates the length of a string using a custom implementation of the `strlen` function.
4. **3-puts.c**: This program prints a string using the `puts` function.
5. **4-print_rev.c**: It prints a string in reverse.
6. **5-rev_string.c**: This program reverses a string.
7. **6-puts2.c**: It prints every other character of a string, starting from the first character.
8. **7-puts_half.c**: This program prints the second half of a string.
9. **8-print_array.c**: It prints elements of an integer array.
10. **9-strcpy.c**: This program copies the content of a string to another string.
11. **100-atoi.c**: It converts a string to an integer.
12. **101-keygen.c**: This program generates a random password of a given length.
13. **102-infinite_add.c**: It adds two positive numbers of arbitrary length.
14. **103-print_buffer.c**: This program prints the content of a buffer.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings` directory:

   ```
   cd your_repository/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
   ```

3. Compile the desired program using a C compiler. For example, to compile program `0-reset_to_98.c`, use the following command:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-reset_to_98.c -o 0-reset_to_98
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```
   ./0-reset_to_98
   ```
